For docs generation I used doxygen GUI, which generates html format documentation with all comments and descriptions.

You can download it from here:
https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html

After installation, you can use simple wizard to configure docs.

I've filled:

Specify the working directory from which doxygen will run:
<directory for temp doxygen processing>

WIZARD TAB
Project name: List11Python
Project version or id: 1.0.0
Source code directory: <root path to my project>
Scan recursively: True
Destination directory: <root path to my project>/docs

RUN TAB
Just click "Run doxygen"

After finishing, documentation will be available in:
<root path to my project>/docs/index.html
